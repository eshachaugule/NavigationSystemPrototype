# NavigationSystemPrototype
Prototype for an android application that helps visually impaired people to navigate using voice commands.
Beacons are emerging sensors that are increasingly being used for indoor positioning in shopping malls and airports. They make use of Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which is widely supported by today's smartphones. This prototype focuses on a mobile application that uses beacons to assist people with special needs. This application provides a voice interface for navigating within stations, buses, and trains. We consume Google Transit Feed Specification data and conduct analysis of crowd estimation. We analyze ‘ridership data’ in order to extract contextual data about the commuter’s environment to provide a cognitive solution and assistance during travel. Our ultimate goal is to improve public transportation for visually impaired people. We have published a paper on this research in Springer’s International Conference on Data Management, Analytics & Innovation (ICDMAI) 2022 (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-2600-6_47)
